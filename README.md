# oci-free-tier-k8s-gitops-lab
Self-managed Kubernetes and GitOps Lab on Oracle Cloud Free Tier: Automating cluster deployment, GitOps workflows, and observability using Terraform, Ansible, and open-source tools. 
# OCI Free Tier Kubernetes GitOps Lab

A hands-on DevOps laboratory for deploying, automating, and managing a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Free Tier. This project leverages Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), Configuration Management (Ansible), modern GitOps workflows (Argo CD/Flux), and full observability (Prometheus, Grafana). Extendable with AI-based monitoring and anomaly detection.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- **Use Oracle Cloud Free Tier** resources for cost-effective experimentation.
- **Automate infrastructure** provisioning with Terraform.
- **Configure and bootstrap Kubernetes** (k3s, kubeadm, or microk8s) with Ansible. (need to decide)
- **Implement GitOps deployment pipelines** using Argo CD or Flux. (need to decide)
- **Deploy sample applications** and manage configs through Git.
- **Monitor cluster health and workloads** with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Experiment with AI-powered monitoring** (simple anomaly detection as a stretch goal).
- **Document and share** the process for knowledge building and careers.
